#### Project Status: View the original project [LearnTheseThings](https://github.com/Gabs00/LearnTheseThings) to fork 


## <a name="instructions"></a>Instructions

* Fork this repo
* Find a programming language that you want to learn
* Check out the 'List of things to learn' below to get an idea of what you will be learning
* Run the generator to set up a directory for the language(See generator instructions)
* Work through the list in the directory:
 * The languages directory contains:
    1. Readme.md with the list of things to learn
    2. A folder for each thing
    3. Inside each folder is a Readme.md file with instructions a space for notes
* As you work through the steps, take notes about what you are learning. (hints included)
* Complete the project at the end
* Start on another language!

##<a name="things"></a> A list of things to learn in any programming

1. Setting up the environment (and other configy things)
2. Variables and variable assignment
3. Programming Structure
4. Data Structures
5. Conditional Structures
6. Looping Structures
7. Functions / Subroutines / Methods
7. Class Creation
8. Working with STDIN, STDOUT,and Files

##<a name="generator"></a> Using the generators

* Perl: (a default install on Mac OS X and Linux)

	`perl gen.pl <language>`
* Bash: WIP
* Python: WIP
* Node: From within the project directory (Windows should use this)

  `./node.exe gen.js`
* PowerShell: WIP
* batch: WIP


##<a name="todo"></a> To Do:
1. Create Readme's for each step
2. Create test for generators
3. Create `starter.json` with a few starter languages

##<a name="contributing"></a>Contributing

 You can contribute by:

##<a name="about"></a>About
> #### LearnTheseThings
* **Purpose:** A way to learn the basics of a language, and keep nuggets of information as refreshers when needed.
* **Notes? Why Notes?:** Because we forget things. Especially when we don't do them very often. I'v learned a few programming languages in the past, but due to not using them, I've mostly forgotten how to use them. I've started taking notes on everything now. If it seems useful, I create a secret gist.
