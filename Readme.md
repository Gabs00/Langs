## Want to learn the basics of a new language?

> Fork this repo and follow the below instructions! You will learn the basics and keep notes along the way. The notes will always be available when you need to reference them.

## Instructions

* Fork this repo
* Find a programming language that you want to learn
* Check out the 'List of things to learn' below to get an idea of what you will be learning
* Run the generator to set up a directory for the language(See generator instructions)
* Work through the list in the directory:
 * The languages directory contains:
  1. Readme.md with the list of things to learn
  2. A folder for each thing
  3. Inside each folder is a Readme.md file with instructions a space for notes
* As you work through the steps, take notes about what you are learning. (hints included)
* Complete the project at the end 
* Start on another language!

## A list of things to learn in any programming

1. Setting up the environment (and other configy things)
2. Variables and variable assignment
3. Programming Structure
4. Data Structures
5. Conditional Structures
6. Looping Structures
7. Functions / Subroutines / Methods
7. Class Creation
8. Working with STDIN and STDOUT

## Using the generators

* Perl: (a default install on Mac OS X and Linux) 

	`perl gen.pl <language>`
* Bash: WIP
* Python: WIP
* Node: WIP
* PowerShell: WIP
* batch: WIP

## A Project that demonstrates all of the above

### Create a phone directory:

> Use all of the above to create a phone directory application

#### Specs
* Has a Record:
 * Has a name field with value string
 * Has a phone number field with value int

* Has a list of Records

* Set:
 * new Record, adds to list of Records

* Get:
 * All Records
 * All Records with set S that is a subset of names with set N
 * All Records with set S that is a subset of phone number with set P
 * Name lookup with phone number as key
 * Phone number lookup with name as key

* Delete and Update a Record and its fields


## To Do:
1. Create Templates of all steps


##Template Directory Structure

Each sub directory will have their info as a readme

* LANG DIR
 * ReadMe.md
 * SETUP DIR
 * VAR DIR
 * PROGRAMMING STRUCTURE DIR
 * DATA STRUCTURE DIR
 * CONDITIONAL DIR
 * LOOP DIR
 * FUNCTION DIR
 * CLASS DIR
 * STD* DIR
 * PROJECT DIR
