## Programming Structure
Those little nuances of most programming languages

### Know this stuff
1. Required structures:
 * !#
 * main(string args)
 * etc.
2. Scope
3. Curly Brace Usage
4. Language specific nuances
5. Importing Libraries and Modules
  * include statement: Ex. `#include <iostream>`
6. If the language uses namespacing.
  * To namespace the **using directive** is used.
    * Ex. `using namespace std;` allows the use of `cin` and `cout` without fully qualifying them. ie `std::cin`.
